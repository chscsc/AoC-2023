# AoC-2023
Advent of code repository for the Century Computer Science Club.

## Branches
You may have noticed that there is no code in the `master` branch. All solutions are grouped by language in different branches.

| Language | Branch Name | Solved Days |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Python 3 | `python`    | None        |

### Creating a new branch
If you (being a chscsc member) want to contribute code to this repository in a language that does not already have code contributed, then you need to create a branch.

1. Contribute your code
Please create a new branch, typically with the name of the language you are using. Put your contributions in this new branch.
2. Create a pull request that adds your new branch to the table containing all branches. **OR** Have someone from the club leadership add it without a pull request by manually editing the README on `github.com`. This is the ideal method.
