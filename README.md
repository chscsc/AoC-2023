This branch contains solutions for the 2023 Advent of code season using [React](https://react.dev/). It is very close to the NodeJS Solutions, but not identical. These solutions are far more modular currently. 

## Details
**Language**  
It uses normal JavaScript instead of TypeScript because many people are unfamiliar with TypeScript. 

**Component Library**  
This project uses [Mantine](https://mantine.dev).
