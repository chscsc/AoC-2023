# AoC-2023
Advent of code repository for the Century Computer Science Club.

## Branches
You may have noticed that there is no code in the `master` branch. All solutions are grouped by language in different branches.

| Language | Branch Name | Solved Days |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Python 3 | [`python`](https://github.com/chscsc/AoC-2023/tree/python)    | None        |

### Creating a new branch
If you (being a chscsc member) want to contribute code to this repository in a language that does not already have code contributed, then you need to create a branch.

1. Contribute your code
Please create a new branch, typically with the name of the language you are using. Put your contributions in this new branch.  
Also, please make an 'initial commit' in your branch that removes this branches section from the README. This prevents people from being confused when later language branches don't show up in the tables of older ones. An example commit that does this can be found [here for python](https://github.com/chscsc/AoC-2023/commit/5122b218c65959717403cf8fbb8965ed5d3f573c).
2. Create a pull request that adds your new branch to the table containing all branches. **OR** Have someone from the club leadership add it without a pull request by manually editing the README on [`github.com`](https://github.com/chscsc/AoC-2023/edit/master/README.md). This is the ideal method.
